# Arduino-based-Door-Lock
Arduino project made for university

It was based on this project (https://electronicshobbyists.com/rfid-and-keypad-based-door-lock-and-alert-system-using-arduino/) but using a HC-05 bluetooth module instead of the GSM SIM900 module.

The bluetooth app was made using the MIT app inventor. (ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryId=4764407247011840)
